## Next.js course app template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

I'm using the following Libraries:
Stripe for payments (based on the current stripe elements API).
Firebase to manage the users and have a basic DB control on the app.
Firebase cloud functions for set custom roles to the user.
